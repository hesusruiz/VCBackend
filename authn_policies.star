"""
This module should define two functions: 'authenticate' and 'authorize'.
- 'authenticate' is called when performing authentication, and
- 'authorize' is called when actually accessing a protected resource.

Each of those functions should determine if the request is allowed and reply
True (allowed) or False (denied).

The 'authenticate' and 'authorize' functions receive three objects: 'request', 'rawcred' and 'protected_resource'

"request" is a dictionary with the following fields:
    "method": the HTTP method that was used in teh request
    "host": the host header in the request
    "remoteip": the IP of the remote host sending the request
    "url": the complete url of the request
    "path": the url path until the query parameters
    "protocol": the 'http' or 'https' protocol
    "headers": a dictionary with the headres in the HTTP request
    "pathparams": a dictionary wil all the path parameters
    "queryparams": a dictionary with all the query parameters in the url

'rawcred' is a JSON string serialization of the Verifiable Credential received in the request.
'protected_resource' is the url of the resource that the user is trying to access. It maybe empty if only authentication
is being performed, without specifying the resource.
